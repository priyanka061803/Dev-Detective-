Dev Detective is a web-based application that helps users investigate GitHub profiles by fetching and displaying key developer information in a clean, intuitive interface. By simply entering a GitHub username, users can view profile details such as repositories, followers, following count, bio, location, and social links in real time using the GitHub API.

The project focuses on API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive UI design, making it a practical example of how real-world developer tools are built. Dev Detective emphasizes usability, error handling (like invalid usernames), and modern frontend practices to deliver a smooth and informative user experience
